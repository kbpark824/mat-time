<!-- Can we do a code health check? Please check the codebase for vulnerabilities, bugs, duplicate code, or unnecessary or unused code. Make sure you only look for issues that are not already listed in context.md. Don't make any changes to the code yet. Just compile a list of your findings for me to review ranked in order of priority, and within each priority section, ranked from easiest to hardest to implement. -->
