<!-- Ok, great. Can we do another code health check. Are there any lines of code that are serving no purpose? Are there any vulnerabilities or bugs in the code? Anything that needs to be cleaned up? Do a complete analysis of all the code and check to see if there's anything unnecessary or potentially wrong. Don't make any changes to the code yet. Just compile a list of your findings for me to review ranked in order of priority, and within each priority section, ranked from easiest to hardest to implement. -->
